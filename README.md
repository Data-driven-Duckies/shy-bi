# shy-bi

## Synopsis

A dating app for shy bi-sexuals and bi-curious people that uses React for fast performance and Neo4j for relational data storage.

## Motivation

Researchers say bi-sexuals are less likely to come out because they are afraid of being perceived as "confused" or "going through a phase." 

By specifically catering to this segment of the LGBT population, ShyBi hopes to provide a safe place for these individuals to explore their sexual identity.
