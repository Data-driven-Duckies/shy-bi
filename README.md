# shy-bi

## Synopsis

A dating app for shy bi-sexuals and bi-curious people that uses React for fast performance and Neo4j for relational data storage.

## Motivation

Researchers say bi-sexuals are less likely to come out because they are afraid of being perceived as "confused." ShyBi hopes to provide a safe place for these individuals so they may explore their sexual identity without fear of judgment.
