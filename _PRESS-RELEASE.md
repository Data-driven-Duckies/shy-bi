## Who We Are ##
  > A dating app for shy bi-sexuals and bi-curious people.

## Summary ##
  > An estimated 9 million Americans identify themselves as LGBT. Statistics on bi-sexuals have been evasive, and researchers say bis are less likely to come out because of the particular stigma they face -- that they are either "confused" or "going through a phase."
  > ShyBi is here to provide a safe platform for bi individuals to explore their sexual identity.

  > ShyBi allows you to cut to the chase and discover people just like you in seconds.

## Quote from Our Spokesperson ##
  > "Dating for bis should be easier, not harder, than it is for people who prefer one gender over the other."
